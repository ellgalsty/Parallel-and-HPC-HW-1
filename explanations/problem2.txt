Firstly I created an array, then a pointer, pointing on the array's start. Then I printed all array elements using the pointer, like I'm adding the size of each element to the address of it during each iteration to be able to access next element. Alsooo I'm determining the size of array by dividing the size of array in bytes to the size of one element again in bytes. After modifying, I again printed all the values as required.
